        The New Year starts on January 1st of every year. It is the time to start over, make new resolutions, and look forward to a great future ahead. The New Year is a special time for all people as they feel a renewed sense of responsibility in their lives. However, the first day of the New Year always starts a bit slow for everyone as they are still tired from the party from the last day of the previous year. On the other hand, children happily look forward to the reopening of the school after the Christmas vacation. To conclude, every New Year is a step further to what can be a bright and prosperous future.
